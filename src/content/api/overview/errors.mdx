# Errors

## JSON Errors

JSON input that cannot be parsed, results in a 400 response. No more information is provided with the
response, so make sure your JSON is formatted properly!

```json
{
    "id": "bad_request",
    "message": {"error": "Malformed JSON"}
}
```


## Authorization Errors

For some endpoints, an authorized session is required. Authorized sessions are obtained by logging in through the browser.
Accessing user-specific endpoints like `GET /api/account` without an authorized session will result in the following
error:

```json
{
    "id": "requires_login",
    "message": "Requires login"
}
```


## Validation Errors

JSON input data for POST and PUT endpoints are validated prior to handling the request.

Validation errors will result in a 400 response with a JSON body with the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description                                                     |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| loc       | The parameter which generated the error                         |
| msg       | A Human-readable description of the error                       |
| type      | The type of error returned                                      |
| in        | The section of the request which triggered the validation error |


For example, if a request was made that excludes a required parameter `name` from the request's body the following response will be sent:

```json
[
  {
    "loc": ["name"],
    "msg": "field required",
    "type": "value_error.missing",
    "in": "body"
  }
]
```

For the case where more than one parameter validation fails, there will be an equivalent number of entries in the list.

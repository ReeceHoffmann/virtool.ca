# Errors

## JSON Errors

JSON input that cannot be parsed, results in a 400 response. No more information is provided with the
response, so make sure your JSON is formatted properly!

```json
{
    "id": "bad_request",
    "message": {"error": "Malformed JSON"}
}
```


## Authorization Errors

For some endpoints, an authorized session is required. Authorized sessions are obtained by logging in through the browser.
Accessing user-specific endpoints like ``GET /api/account`` without an authorized session will result in the following
error:

```json
{
    "id": "requires_login",
    "message": "Requires login"
}
```


## Validation Errors

JSON input data for POST and PUT endpoints are validated prior to handling the request.

Validation errors will result in a 400 response. The response data includes a list of errors, each with a ``loc`` field
that indicates variable which caused the error, a ``msg`` field that describes the error, a ``type`` field that
indicates the type of error, and an ``in`` field that indicates the location of the error within the request.

```json
[
  {
    "loc": ["name"],
    "msg": "field required",
    "type": "value_error.missing",
    "in": "body"
  }
]
```

In this example the ``name`` field is missing from the request's body. Additional entries may be present in the list if
there is more than one error in the request.
